title: What we do
subtitle: … and how we do it


Some of the questions that guide our research:

1. How does the mind learn to represent the causal structure of the world?
2. What is the relationship between causal thinking and counterfactual simulation?
3. How do we hold others responsible for the outcomes of their actions?
In our research, we formalize people’s mental models as computational models that yield quantitative predictions about a wide range of situations. To test these predictions, we use a combination of large-scale online experiments, interactive experiments in the lab, and eye-tracking experiments.
